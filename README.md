# Development and Update
Since I'm just starting out, I have opened the page with the questions I wrote with the commands if and elif codes. With the new update, I will eliminate this problem by using other conditions or loops instead of if and elif conditions.

### Important notices

Since these codes will answer Turkish questions, you can translate the questions in Turkish into your own language. Also, if you send me your updates or suggestions, I would like to thank you. <3
